[{"commodity": {"name": "Aluminum", "info": "Aluminum, a lightweight and versatile metal, plays a pivotal role in modern industries, from transportation to packaging. This comprehensive overview will delve into the historical context, properties, production methods, applications, demand trends, and an intriguing fun fact about this essential metal.\n\nHistorical Context:\nAluminum was first isolated as a metal in the early 19th century by Danish chemist Hans Christian Oersted and German chemist Friedrich W\u00f6hler. It was initially considered a precious metal due to the difficulty of extracting it. However, advancements in electrolytic methods led to the commercial production of aluminum in the late 19th century.\n\nProperties:\nAluminum is known for its low density, high strength-to-weight ratio, and excellent corrosion resistance. It is also a good conductor of electricity and heat. These properties make aluminum suitable for a wide range of applications across diverse industries.\n\nProduction Methods:\nAluminum is produced from bauxite ore through the Bayer process. Bauxite is refined to produce alumina, which is then reduced in electrolytic cells to obtain pure aluminum metal. This process requires a substantial amount of energy but yields high-purity aluminum.\n\nApplications:\nAluminum's applications are extensive and encompass various sectors. It is used in transportation (automobiles, aircraft, and trains), construction (window frames, roofing, and facades), packaging (cans and foils), electronics, and consumer goods. Its lightweight nature and corrosion resistance contribute to its widespread use.\n\nDemand Trends:\nThe demand for aluminum is closely linked to economic growth, urbanization, and industrial development. As industries continue to evolve and sustainability becomes a priority, aluminum's role in lightweighting, energy efficiency, and recyclability becomes even more significant.\n\nSustainability Considerations:\nAluminum's recyclability is a key environmental advantage. Recycling aluminum requires significantly less energy than producing it from raw materials, making it a valuable material for industries aiming to reduce their carbon footprint.\n\nFun Fact:\nAluminum was once considered more precious than gold and silver and was used to create decorative items and exhibit pieces, including the capstone of the Washington Monument.\n\nIn conclusion, aluminum's historical evolution, exceptional properties, and diverse applications underscore its pivotal role in shaping modern society. As industries continue to prioritize efficiency, sustainability, and technological innovation, aluminum's enduring relevance and versatility will contribute to progress and advancements.", "companies": ["China Hongqiao Group Limited", "United Company RUSAL plc", "Rio Tinto", "Alcoa Corporation", "Norsk Hydro ASA"]}, "gov_info": {"year": 2020, "prod_and_use": "'In 2019, three companies operated seven primary aluminum smelters in six States. Two smelters operated at full capacity and five smelters operated at reduced capacity throughout the year. One other smelter remained on standby throughout the year. Domestic smelters were operating at about 60% of capacity of 1.79 million tons per year in 2019. Production increased for the second year in a row after declining each year since 2012 and was 22% more than that in 2018. Based on published prices, the value of primary aluminum production was about $2.4 billion, 7% more than the value in 2018. The average annual U.S. market price declined by about 13% from that in 2018, partially offsetting the value of the increased production. Transportation applications accounted for 39% of domestic consumption; in descending order of consumption, the remainder was used in packaging, 19%; building, 14%; electrical, 9%; consumer durables, 8%; machinery, 8%; and other, 3%.'", "recycling": "'In 2019, aluminum recovered from purchased scrap in the United States was about 3.4 million tons, of which about 56% came from new (manufacturing) scrap and 44% from old scrap (discarded aluminum products). Aluminum recovered from old scrap was equivalent to about 45% of apparent consumption.'", "events": "'A 252,000-ton-per-year smelter in Hawesville, KY, shut down one potline with 50,000 tons per year of capacity in June for scheduled maintenance work. Another 50,000-ton-per-year potline at the Hawesville smelter was shut down for maintenance work in October ahead of a scheduled shutdown. Both potlines were scheduled to be restarted in 2020. In January, a 2-year power supply agreement took effect between a primary aluminum smelter in Mt. Holly, SC, and its power provider. In March, a 7-year power supply agreement between the owner of the 130,000-metric-ton-per-year Massena, NY, smelter and its power provider was signed. In September, workers represented by the United Steelworkers union ratified a 4-year contract covering about 1,700 employees, most of whom were located at a 269,000-metric-ton-per-year smelter in Evansville, IN, the smelter in Massena, NY, and a rolling mill in Gum Springs, AR. The new contract was retroactive to May 15 when the prior contract expired, and production was not disrupted during the negotiations.  In January, the U.S. Department of the Treasury lifted sanctions that were imposed against a Russian producer of aluminum, alumina, and bauxite in April 2018 in response to activities of the Government of Russia. Prior to the sanctions being lifted, a winddown period was granted to companies with contracts with the sanctioned company. The winddown period was extended several times until the sanctions were lifted and deliveries to consumers in the United States were not disrupted.  After the United States, Canada, and Mexico reached an agreement on trade terms, Presidential Proclamation 9893, issued in May 2019, removed the 10% ad valorem tariff on imports of aluminum from Canada and Mexico. The tariff on aluminum imports for Canada and Mexico was imposed under the authority of Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 in 2018. Canada and Mexico agreed to remove retaliatory measures that were imposed on United States products. Under the agreement, a quota on aluminum imports was not imposed, but if imports increased dramatically compared with historical volumes, the United States reserved the right to reimpose the tariff and Canada and Mexico reserved the right to reimpose retaliatory measures. Aluminum imports from all countries except Argentina, Australia, Canada, and Mexico remained subject to the 10% ad valorem tariff as of early December.  On October 22, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced its final determination in an antidumping investigation of imports of aluminum wire from China, which affirmed the preliminary finding announced May 30. The finding determined that aluminum cable and wire from China was sold below fair market value and antidumping rates of duty ranging from 58.51% to 63.47% were assigned.

Arizona was the leading copper-producing State and accounted for an estimated 68% of domestic output, followed by, in descending order, Utah, New Mexico, Nevada, Montana, Michigan, and Missouri. Twenty-four mines recovered copper, 15 of which accounted for 99% of production. Three smelters, 3 electrolytic refineries, 4 fire refineries, and 14 electrowinning facilities operated during 2019. Refined copper and scrap were used at about 30 brass mills, 15 rod mills, and 500 foundries and miscellaneous consumers. Copper and copper alloy products were used in building construction, 43%; electrical and electronic products, 20%; transportation equipment, 20%; consumer and general products, 10%; and industrial machinery and equipment, 7%.1'", "recycling": "'Old (post-consumer) scrap, converted to refined metal and alloys, provided an estimated 160,000 tons of copper, equivalent to 9% of apparent consumption. Purchased new (manufacturing) scrap, derived from fabricating operations, yielded an estimated 710,000 tons of copper. Of the total copper recovered from scrap (including aluminum- and nickel-base scrap), brass and wire-rod mills recovered approximately 80%; copper smelters, refiners, and ingot makers, 15%; and miscellaneous chemical plants, foundries, and manufacturers, 5%. Copper in all scrap contributed about 35% of the U.S. copper supply.'", "events": "'In 2019, U.S. mine production of copper increased by an estimated 6% owing to higher ore grades and (or) higher mining and milling rates at several operations. Output from the Mission Mine rose from that in 2018, when production was significantly affected by a landslide early in the year. On October 11, about 75% of unionized workers at a company with mines and plants in Arizona and Texas voted to go on strike. The company announced that it would temporarily close its smelter and refinery but did not address the status of its Arizona mines. Non-striking workers may have continued to extract ore at some sites, based on media reports. Production of refined copper in the United States fell by an estimated 7% as a result of the strike, which had not been resolved as of early December, and maintenance shutdowns at two other smelters. Two projects (Gunnison in Arizona and Pumpkin Hollow in Nevada) planned to begin production by yearend but had not started up as of the end of November. Estimated global mine production of copper decreased slightly to 20 million tons in 2019 from 20.4 million tons in 2018, owing primarily to reduced output from the Batu Hijau and Grasberg Mines in Indonesia, where mining was shifting to new ore zones. Production also declined in Chile as a result of lower ore grades, strikes, and weather-related disruptions. These decreases were partially offset by increased output from multiple other countries. Global refined production increased slightly to an estimated 25 million tons in 2019 from 24.4 million tons in 2018. Higher refinery capacity in China was mostly offset by smelter shutdowns for maintenance and upgrades in other countries. In Zambia, mined and refined copper output were affected by a new import duty on copper concentrates, which lowered smelter production and constrained the supply of sulfuric acid needed to produce electrowon copper.  Through November 2019, the monthly average COMEX spot copper price varied between $2.56 per pound (October) and $2.92 per pound (April).

Early in the year the gold price was about of $1,580 per troy ounce before decreasing in March and increasing to an alltime high of about $2,060 per troy ounce in August. During this time, several factors were reported to have caused the increase in price: gold demand increased to safe-haven buying as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic and global investor uncertainty; the U.S. Federal Reserve Board cut interest rates; and trade negotiations halted between the United States and China. The price started a downward trend in October and November. The 5% decrease in domestic mine production in 2020 was attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, worldwide gold mine production was estimated to be 3% less than that in 2019.

In Missouri, a company built a flotation plant and produced nickel-copper-cobalt concentrate from historic mine tailings. Most U.S. cobalt supply comprised imports and secondary (scrap) materials. Approximately six companies in the United States produced cobalt chemicals. About 46% of the cobalt consumed in the United States was used in superalloys, mainly in aircraft gas turbine engines; 9% in cemented carbides for cutting and wear- resistant applications; 14% in various other metallic applications; and 31% in a variety of chemical applications.

With the exception of production in Morocco and artisanally mined cobalt in Congo (Kinshasa), most cobalt is mined as a byproduct of copper or nickel. China was the worlds leading producer of refined cobalt, most of which it produced from partially refined cobalt imported from Congo (Kinshasa). China was the worlds leading consumer of cobalt, with more than 80% of its consumption being used by the rechargeable battery industry. During the first 7 months of 2019, cobalt prices generally trended downward, which analysts attributed to oversupply and consumer destocking and deferral of purchases. In early August, a Switzerland-based producer and marketer of commodities announced that, owing to low cobalt prices, it planned to place its world-leading cobalt mine on care-and-maintenance status by yearend 2019. Following the announcement, cobalt prices increased, then stabilized. '", "world_resources": "'Identified cobalt resources of the United States are estimated to be about 1 million tons. Most of these resources are in Minnesota, but other important occurrences are in Alaska, California, Idaho, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, Oregon, and Pennsylvania. With the exception of resources in Idaho and Missouri, any future cobalt production from these deposits would be as a byproduct of another metal. Identified world terrestrial cobalt resources are about 25 million tons. The vast majority of these resources are in sediment-hosted stratiform copper deposits in Congo (Kinshasa) and Zambia; nickel-bearing laterite deposits in Australia and nearby island countries and Cuba; and magmatic nickel-copper sulfide deposits hosted in mafic and ultramafic rocks in Australia, Canada, Russia, and the United States.

The cobalt contents of lithium-ion batteries, the leading global use for cobalt, are expected to be reduced rather than eliminated; nickel contents of lithium-ion batteries will increase as cobalt contents decrease. Potential substitutes in other applications include barium or strontium ferrites, neodymium-iron-boron, or nickel-iron alloys in magnets; cerium, iron, lead, manganese, or vanadium in paints; cobalt-iron-copper or iron-copper in diamond tools; copper-iron-manganese for curing unsaturated polyester resins; iron, iron-cobalt-nickel, nickel, cermets, or ceramics in cutting and wear-resistant

Alternatively, hard rock mining involves extracting lithium-bearing minerals like spodumene or lepidolite, which are then subjected to crushing, grinding, and beneficiation processes to extract lithium concentrates.\n\nMining Difficulty:\nThe complexity of lithium extraction varies depending on the source. Brine extraction is generally less energy-intensive but requires extensive evaporation time, while hard rock mining demands substantial energy for mineral processing. Additionally, technological advancements have reduced the environmental impact of extraction methods.\n\nDemand Trends:\nLithium's demand has been intricately tied to its pivotal role in lithium-ion batteries. As the world shifts towards sustainable energy solutions and electric mobility, the demand for lithium-ion batteries has soared. Electric vehicles, renewable energy storage systems, and portable electronic devices rely on lithium-ion batteries for efficient energy storage and delivery. Consequently, the demand for lithium is projected to continue its upward trajectory in the foreseeable future.\n\nFuture Prospects:\nThe demand for lithium is expected to rise as nations intensify efforts to transition to cleaner energy sources and reduce carbon emissions. The expansion of electric vehicle markets, coupled with advancements in energy storage technologies, will likely drive sustained demand for lithium. However, the industry also faces challenges related to supply chain sustainability, responsible mining practices, and efficient recycling methods to mitigate environmental impacts.\n\nFun Fact:\nLithium, as a mood-stabilizing medication, has been used to treat bipolar disorder and other mental health conditions for decades. Its ability to modulate brain chemistry has provided relief to countless individuals, illustrating the resource's influence not only on technological advancements but also on human well-being.\n\nIn conclusion, lithium stands as a cornerstone of modern technology, owing its prominence to its role in lithium-ion batteries.

The share of steel produced by basic oxygen furnaces, the process that uses iron ore, continued to decline from 37.3% in 2015 to an estimated 30% in 2019 owing to increased use of electric arc furnaces because of their energy efficiency, reduced environmental impacts, and the ready supply of scrap. Overall, global prices trended upwards in 2019 and the annual average value of $112.15 per ton was a 21% increase from $93.00 per ton in 2018. Based on reported prices for iron ore fines (62% iron content) imported into China (cost and freight into Tianjin port), the highest monthly average price during the first 10 months of 2019 was $120.24 per ton in July compared with the high of $77.46 per ton in February 2018. The lowest monthly average price during the same period in 2019 was $76.16 per ton in January compared with the low of $64.56 per ton in July 2018. The prices trended upwards owing to an estimated 4% increase in raw steel production and a reduced supply of higher grade iron ore products, spurred partially by closures of pelletizing plants in Brazil. In August, one company completed a project at an iron-ore-processing facility in Minnesota enabling the plant to produce 3.5 million tons per year of direct-reduced-iron-grade pellets that will feed into a hot-briquetted plant under construction in Ohio, which was expected to open in mid-2020. Globally, iron ore production in 2019 was expected to increase by 5% from that of 2018, primarily owing to increased production in Australia, Brazil, China, and India. Global finished steel demand was forecast by the World Steel Association5 to increase by 3.9% in 2019 and 1.7% in 2020, as a result of real estate investment in China and 4.1% growth in emerging and developing economies in 2020. Steel demand among developed economies, except for China, was expected to remain the same or decrease slightly in 2019 despite growth in consumer and construction applications as potential and enacted trade policies impacted investments and exports among the manufacturing sector. Increased pressure on steel producers around the world to increase efficiency, reduce energy consumption, and meet environmental benchmarks continued the slow decline in use of low-grade iron ore and spurred investment in the production of iron metallics and high-grade iron ore products, such as pellets.'", "world_resources": "'U.S. resources are estimated to be 110 billion tons of iron ore containing about 27 billion tons of iron. U.S. resources are mainly low-grade taconite-type ores from the Lake Superior district that require beneficiation and agglomeration prior to commercial use. World resources are estimated to be greater than 800 billion tons of crude ore containing more than 230 billion tons of iron.'", "substitutes": "'The only source of primary iron is iron ore, used directly as direct-shipping ore or converted to briquettes, concentrates, DRI, iron nuggets, pellets, or sinter. DRI, iron nuggets, and scrap are extensively used for steelmaking in electric arc furnaces and in iron and steel foundries. Technological advancements have been made, which allow hematite to be recovered from tailings basins and pelletized.'"}, "production": [{"country": "United States", "metric": "1000 MT", "amount":

Silver was produced at 4 silver mines and as a byproduct or coproduct from 33 domestic base- and precious-metal operations. Alaska continued as the countrys leading silver-producing State, followed by Nevada. There were 24 U.S. refiners that reported production of commercial-grade silver with an estimated total output of 2,500 tons from domestic and foreign ores and concentrates and from new and old scrap. The physical properties of silver include high ductility, electrical conductivity, malleability, and reflectivity. In 2019, the estimated domestic uses for silver were electrical and electronics, 30%; jewelry and silverware, 26%; coins and medals, 12%; photography, 3%; and other, 29%. Other applications for silver include use in antimicrobial bandages, clothing, pharmaceuticals, and plastics; batteries; bearings; brazing and soldering; catalytic converters in automobiles; electroplating; inks; mirrors; photovoltaic solar cells; water purification; and wood treatment. Mercury and silver, the main components of dental amalgam, are biocides, and their use in amalgam inhibits recurrent decay.'", "recycling": "'In 2019, approximately 1,100 tons of silver was recovered from new and old scrap, about 17% of apparent consumption.'", "events": "'The estimated average silver price in 2019 was $16.20 per troy ounce, 3% higher than the average price in 2018. The price began the year at $15.46 per troy ounce, then decreased to a low of $14.37 per troy ounce on May 28. The price increased to a high of $19.40 per troy ounce on September 4 before trending downward through November. In 2019, global consumption of silver was estimated to have increased slightly from that of 2018. Coin and bar consumption increased for the third year in a row. Consumption for jewelry and silverware was also estimated to have increased in 2019. Photography and other industrial uses decreased in 2019. Overall, production in the global silver market was estimated to have been greater than consumption in 2019 resulting in an excess supply of silver; however, investor purchases were expected to more than offset the surplus and support the higher silver price.8 World silver mine production increased slightly in 2019 to an estimated 27,000 tons, principally as a result of increased production from mines in Argentina, Australia, Mexico, and Poland. Some silver-producing mines in Chile and Peru experienced reductions in production owing to protester blockades and worker strikes. Domestic silver mine production increased by 5% in 2019 compared with that in 2018 principally from increased production at mining operations in Alaska.'", "world_resources": "'Although silver was a principal product at several mines, silver was primarily obtained as a byproduct from lead-zinc mines, copper mines, and gold mines, in descending order of production. The polymetallic ore deposits from which silver was recovered account for more than two-thirds of U.S. and world resources of silver. Most recent silver discoveries have been associated with gold occurrences; however, copper and lead-zinc occurrences that contain byproduct silver will continue to account for a significant share of reserves and resources in the future.'", "substitutes": "'Digital imaging, film with reduced silver content, silverless black-and-white film, and xerography substitute for traditional photographic applications for silver. Surgical pins and plates may be made with stainless steel, tantalum, and titanium in place of silver. Stainless steel may be substituted for silver flatware. Nonsilver batteries may replace silver batteries in some applications. Aluminum and rhodium may be used to replace silver that was traditionally used in mirrors and other reflecting surfaces.

According to the International Lead and Zinc Study Group,8 global refined zinc production in 2020 was estimated to increase slightly to 13.60 million tons, and metal consumption was estimated decrease by 5% to 12.98 million tons, resulting in a production-to-consumption surplus of about 620,000 tons of refined zinc. Domestic zinc mine production decreased in 2020, owing partially to the closure of the Pend Oreille Mine in Washington State in 2019 after current reserves were exhausted and a decrease in production at the Red Dog Mine in Alaska related to the mining of lower grade ores after a change in the mine plan to manage water levels at the site. Refined zinc production increased after the reopening of an idled secondary zinc refinery in North Carolina in March. Apparent consumption of refined zinc decreased to an estimated 860,000 tons in 2020, consistent with a contraction in the domestic steel industry during the year as a result of the pandemic.
